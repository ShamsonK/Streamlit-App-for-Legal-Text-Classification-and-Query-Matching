Section 3,"General explanations. —(1) throughout this sanhita every definition of an offence, every penal provision,  and every illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood  subject  to the exceptions contained in the chapter entitled “general exceptions ”, though those exceptions are not  repeated in such definition, penal provision, or illustration .  illustration s.  (a) the sections in this sanhita, which contain definitions of offences, do not express  that a child  under seven years of age cannot commit such offences; but the definitions are to  be understood subject to  the general exception which provides that nothing shall be an  offence which is done by a child under  seven years of age.   (b) a, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends z, who has committed  murder. here  a is not  guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend  z, and therefore the  case falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is  an offence which is done by a  person who is bound by law  to do it ”.  (2) every expression which is explained in any part of this sanhita, is used in every part of this  sanhita in conformity with the explanation.   (3) when property is in the possession of a person’s spouse, clerk or servant, on account of that  person, it is in that person’s possession within the meaning of this sanhita.  19   explanation. —a person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity of a clerk  or servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub -section.   (4) in e very part of this sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words  which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.   (5) when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,  each o f such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.   (6) whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or  intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who j oins in the act with such knowledge or  intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge  or intention.   (7) wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an  omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by  an omission is the same offence.   illustration .  a intentionally causes z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give z food, and partly by  beating z.  a has committed murder.   (8) when an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the  commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person,  commits that o ffence.   illustration s.  (a) a and b agree to murder z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison.  a and b administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder z. z dies from the  effects the several doses of poiso n so administered to him. here a and b intentionally cooperate in the  commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty  of the offence though their acts are separate.   (b) a and b are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours  at a time. a and b, intending to cause z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally  omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish z with food supplie d to them for that purpose.  z dies of hunger. both a and b are guilty of the murder of z.   (c) a, a jailor, has the charge of z, a prisoner. a, intending to cause z’s death, illegally omits to  supply z with food; in consequence of which z is much reduced in  strength, but the starvation is not  sufficient to cause his death. a is dismissed from his office, and b succeeds him. b, without collusion or  cooperation with a, illegally omits to supply z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause z’s  death.  z dies of hunger. b is guilty of murder, but, as a did not cooperate with b. a is guilty only of an  attempt to commit murder.   (9) where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be  guilty of different offences by means of that act.   illustration .  a attacks z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of z would be only  culpable homicide not amounting to murder. b, having ill -will towards z and intending to kill him, and  not having been subject  to the provocation, assists a in killing z. here, though a and b are both engaged  in causing z’s death, b is guilty of murder, and a is guilty only of culpable homicide.   chapter ii   of punishments","General explanations. —(1) throughout this sanhita every definition of an offence, every penal provision,  and every illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood  subject  to the exceptions contained in the chapter entitled “general exceptions ”, though those exceptions are not  repeated in such definition, penal provision, or illustration .  illustration s.

(d) a appears as a witness before z, a magistrate. z says that he does not believe a word of a’s  deposition, and that a has perjured himself. a is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills z.  this is murder.   (e) a attempts to pull z’s nose. z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of a to  prevent him from doing so. a is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills z.  this is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of  private defence.   (f) z strikes b. b is by this provocation excited  to violent rage. a, a bystander, intending to take  advantage of b’s rage, and to cause him to kill z, puts a knife into b’s hand for that purpose. b kills z  with the knife. here b may have committed only culpable homicide, but a is guilty of murder.   excep tion 2.—culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the  right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the  death of the person against whom he is exercising such right o f defence without premeditation, and  without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.   illustration .  z attempts to horsewhip a, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to a. a draws out a pistol.  z persists in the assault. a believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from  being horsewhipped, shoots z dead. a has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.   exception  3.—culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a  public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and  causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due  discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill -will towards the person whose death is  caused.   exception  4.—culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden  fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offen der’s having taken undue  advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.   explanation. —it is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first  assault.   exception  5.—culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above  the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.   illustration .  a, by instigation, voluntarily causes z, a child to commit suicide. here, on account of z’s youth, he  was incapable of giving con sent to his own death; a has therefore abetted murder.",culpable homicide,Section 117,"murder, cases, hereinafter, excepted, culpable, homicide, murder, act, death, caused, intention, causing, death, b, act, death, caused,
